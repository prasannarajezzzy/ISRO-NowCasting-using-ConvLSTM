# ISRO-NowCasting-using-ConvLSTM
Nowcasting refers to the short-term prediction of weather conditions, typically within the next few hours.  This repository aims to leverage the power of ConvLSTM, which is a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to forecast weather conditions at high spatiotemporal resolutions.
